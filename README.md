This is a pretty simple Node.js exercise, the goal is to:

1. Test your Node.js installation
2. Setup Git practices (branches & pull requests)
3. Get a first feeling of Node.js

## Instructions

Create a program that writes the current time stamp to a file every second.
You have succeeded if the end file looks like:

```
1526136935103
1526136936103
1526136937102
```

You will need to use Node.js' [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module, the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object and a way to call a function every second.

## Step by step

1. Get a copy of this repository
2. Clone it on your computer
3. Initialize a new Node.js project
4. Create an index.js file to write your code
5. Run your program to check the result
6. Commit your changes and push
7. Visit your GitHub repository and create a pull request
